# {easystats-dashboard}

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of {easystats-dashboard} is to present an overview of
open-source activity of the easystats team.

This is adapted from [ThinkR-open
dashboard](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/thinkrdashboard), which itself
relies on [Jim Hester tidyverse
Dashboard](https://github.com/jimhester/tidyversedashboard).
