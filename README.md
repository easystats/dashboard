# {dashboard}

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of {dashboard} is to present an overview of open-source
activity of the ‘easystats’ team.

This is adapted from [ThinkR-open
dashboard](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/thinkrdashboard), which itself
relies on [Jim Hester’s ‘tidyverse’
Dashboard](https://github.com/jimhester/tidyversedashboard).
